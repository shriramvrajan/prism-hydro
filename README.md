## Hydrological model of Panama

This project is intended to eventually cover the following:
- Interpolation of precipitation gauge data
- Preparation of SWAT input
- Validation of hydrological output (runoff)

Note that the SWAT model folder is not included due to space concerns. This repository is intended to make available the code for the above steps as well as input data and some SWAT output for validation. Feel free to contact me at shriram.varadarajan@mail.mcgill.ca for any further information.

This project is still under construction and will be updated periodically.
